dci-rails-blog-example
======================

An example Rails blog app using DCI.

What is DCI?
------------

DCI (Data Contexts Interactions) is an approach to object oriented programming that aims to increase code mainability and readability.  It achieves this end by factoring all business logic into two new types of constructs, contexts and roles.  Furthermore, it advocates for dumb (read: skinny) data models.

Why this project?
-----------------

As of writing (May 2014), the information available on DCI is a hodgepodge of poorly-explained code examples, a single comprehensive but overly verbose book (Lean Architecture), and a couple poorly-written ebooks.  I've created this app to give a simple and well-explained example to help anyone with an interest in this exciting approach to writing apps learn more about it.

A second goal of this example app is to provide guidance specifically for building _Rails_ apps.  I encourage you to use this app as a template if you agree with its design.  At its core, I have designed the app to use DCI, and I have also extended the paradigm to ease any future transition to service-oriented architecture (SOA).
